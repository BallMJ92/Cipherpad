 Methods to achieve this:
 1. Send obfuscated Public key from session owner to session members. 
 2. Implement protocol to verify successful reciept of key over transparent network
 
 - Develop and add in-built commands for users to control and manipulate program (to a certain extent) without breaking any trust
